<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A 21 year girl just trying out different d=stuff to find her interests. I am a student at IIT DELHI. Despite being in chemical engineering branch, I am trying my hands in web development.</p>
<h3>Real Me</h3>
<p>Honestly, I believe in Newton's 3rd law, which typically says that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In real life the reaction may be delayed but you will definitely
  get the reaction for your actions, whether it may be for good deeds or bad.</p>

<p>People think I am introvert, (many people may relate to me) but actually Idts. 
  Beacuse I know, I talk more than enough, just depends on the person, with whom I am talking to, 
  whether I wanna invest my efforts for that person or not.
